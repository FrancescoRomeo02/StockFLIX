5th year high school graduation project, a.y. 2020/21. The project is the working simulation of a trading site, each user has the possibility to register and trade shares whose price follows the real one.

- **HTML and CSS Mastery**: Through crafting the structure and design of my webpage, I honed my HTML and CSS skills, learning to create visually appealing and responsive layouts.
- **JavaScript for Interactivity**: Implementing interactive elements using JavaScript enriched the user experience.
-  **User authentication**: thanks php and sql I implemented a working user registration and account verification.

### SERVER SIDE
- **Data management**: I learned how to organize a large amount of data in a SQL database, especially data related to users' portfolios and stock values.
